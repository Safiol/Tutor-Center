Tutor Center Queue System

This project is designed to optimize the CSCI tutoring process by introducing a queue management system. It will allow students to join a queue, display estimated wait times, and collect data on each tutoring session. The system will feature two distinct user interfaces: one for tutors to manage their sessions and another for students to view their place in the queue.
